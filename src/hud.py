"""Floating HUD: a non-activating panel beside the chat app showing intent, risk and ranked replies.

Design notes
  * NSWindowStyleMaskNonactivatingPanel + floating level: the panel never steals focus
    from the chat app, and window-ID capture means it never appears in our own screenshots.
  * Poll loop: read the chat, hash the newest message, judge only when it changes.
  * The moment a new message is SEEN, both halves start (local pre-judge and the paid
    generation run concurrently, latest-wins); the settle gate then spends the finished
    verdict, waits out whatever generation is still missing, and only the local ranking
    (~0.5 s) is left after it. Candidates display before ranking finishes ("排序中")
    and are re-ordered in place when it lands.
  * The panel positions itself against the chat app's window each tick, so it follows moves,
    resizes and monitor changes without any window-server hooks.
  * The HUD uses native macOS vibrancy with semantic green/amber/red accents. The
    Appearance stays pinned to Aqua so labels and controls keep the same tested contrast.
  * 「填入」 is dispatched through the per-app adapter layer (src/apps/) into the current
    chat app's input box (OCR path: accessibility writes via src/fill.py; text path: AX value-set
    with a keyboard-events fallback). No clipboard, and nothing is ever sent. It needs
    the Accessibility permission; when that is missing the HUD asks for it and reports
    the failure.
